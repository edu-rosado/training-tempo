# TrainingTempo

### A simple metronome / stopwatch made with Svelte and Sveltekit

Designed with artistic gymnastics training in mind, TrainingTempo allows you to do exercises at a certain candency just like a metronome would let you do, with the additional feature of setting the number of repetitions you want to perform, after which it will stop. I couldn't find a metronome with this feature (with a quick search) so here's one.

It's a very simple implementation, closer to a proof of concept than to a real product, however it works without issue at the time of writing.
Demo is being hosted for the moment at Vercel [here](https://training-tempo.vercel.app/)
